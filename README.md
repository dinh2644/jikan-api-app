# Web Development Project 4 - Anime Content Discovery

Submitted by: Tu Dinh

This web app: Uses JikanAPI to let users explore all types of anime related content in a single view with attributes. Users can also ban attributes they don't want to see.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Trying to ban the attribute from fetching in the new "random" fetch took more than half of the time I spent building the project. I couldn't really find any way to edit the query parameter itself since my API or knowledge lacks that ability.
